note that
1.when pokedata, 'void*data' should not be a address of a value, but the value directly.
2.for 'void*addr', addr must be type-cast by (void*)addr
3.must wait a little time after attach or will receive errno=3 which means no process can be found; use 'waitpid'
4.PTRACE_PEEKDATA's success should be judged by errno, for the return value can be -1
